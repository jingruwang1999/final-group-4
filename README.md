App Name: iBounce

The purpose of our app: iBounce is to give people who are not musically talented a chance to explore and create music with a fun and interactive game.

How the game works: Users are led to an interface that lets them choose between 2 options: dubstep or instrument. After choosing an option, a ball will appear in the center of the screen. By rotating or shaking the device, the ball will bounce around the screen and each time it hits a section or corner of the edge of the screen, a synthesized note or loop will be played. The tempo of the played sounds will increase or decrease in correlation with the acceleration of the user’s shaking or rotating of the device. This way, the user can create his or her on music by simply rotating the screen or users can also challenge themselves to rotate the screen in a specific way to hit the notes that they’d like to create the music they want.
